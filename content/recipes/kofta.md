## Ingredients:
* {{% scalee 0.75 %}} pounds ground lamb
* {{% scalee 0.75 %}} pounds ground beef
* {{% scalee 0.5 %}} cup breadcrumbs
* {{% scalee 2 %}} teaspoons kosher salt
* {{% scalee 0.5 %}} teaspoon black pepper
* {{% scalee 0.5 %}} cup finely diced red onion
* {{% scalee 1 %}} teaspoon toasted ground cumin
* {{% scalee 1 %}} teaspoon toasted ground coriander
* {{% scalee 0.25 %}} teaspoon cinnamon
* {{% scalee 1 %}} Pinch of cayenne
* {{% scalee 2 %}} eggs

## Recipe:
1. **One day ahead**: In a large bowl, use your hands to combine lamb,
   breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, onion, cumin, coriander, cinnamon and
   cayenne. Beat the eggs and add to meat, mixing until
   incorporated. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 24 hours to
   allow the seasonings to permeate the meat.

2. Stick a wad of the meat puree onto a kebab sword. Keep meat and
   swords in fridge until ready to cook to keep the fats from melting
   and meat from falling off.

3. Place sword over a barbecue. Cook until done.
