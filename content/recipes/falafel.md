Makes 30 - 34 falafel balls

Based off of https://toriavey.com/falafel/

## Ingredients:
{{% ingredients %}}
{{% scalee 1 %}} lb dry chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans) - you must start with dry, do NOT substitute canned, they will not work!
{{% scalee 0.5 %}} tsp baking soda
{{% scalee 1 %}} small onion, roughly chopped
{{% scalee 0.25 %}} cup chopped fresh parsley
{{% scalee 3 %}}-{{% scalee 5 %}} cloves garlic (I prefer roasted garlic cloves)
{{% scalee 1.5 %}} tbsp flour or chickpea flour
{{% scalee 1.75 %}} tsp salt
{{% scalee 2 %}} tsp cumin
{{% scalee 1 %}} tsp ground coriander
{{% scalee 0.25 %}} tsp black pepper
{{% scalee 0.25 %}} tsp cayenne pepper
{{% scalee 1 %}} Pinch of ground cardamom
{{% scalee 1 %}} tsp baking powder (optional - makes the falafel more fluffy)
Enough vegetable oil for frying - grapeseed, sunflower, avocado, canola, and peanut oils all work well

## Recipe:

1. **One day ahead** : Pour the chickpeas into a large bowl and cover
   them by about 3 inches of cold water. Add {{% scalee 0.5 %}} tsp of
   baking soda to the water and stir; this will help soften the
   chickpeas. Cover the bowl and let them soak overnight in a cool,
   dark place or in the refrigerator. The chickpeas should soak at
   least 12 hours and up to 24 hours, until tender (change soaking
   water for fresh water after 12 hours). They will double in size as
   they soak – you will have between {{% scalee 4 %}} and {{% scalee 5
   %}} cups of beans after soaking.

2. Drain and rinse the chickpeas well. Pour them into your food
   processor along with the chopped onion, garlic cloves, parsley,
   flour or chickpea flour (use chickpea flour to make gluten free),
   salt, cumin, ground coriander, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and
   cardamom.

3. Pulse all ingredients together until a rough, coarse meal
   forms. Scrape the sides of the processor periodically and push the
   mixture down the sides. Process until the mixture is somewhere
   between the texture of couscous and a paste. You want the mixture
   to hold together, and a more paste-like consistency will help with
   that… but don't over-process, you don't want it turning into
   hummus!

4. Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, pour it out into
   a bowl and use a fork to stir; this will make the texture more even
   throughout. Remove any large chickpea chunks that the processor
   missed.

   Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.

   Fill a skillet with oil to a depth of 1 ½ inches. Use cooking oil
   with a high smoke point (oil suggestions can be found in the
   ingredient list). Heat the oil slowly over medium heat. The ideal
   temperature to fry falafel is between 360 and 375 degrees F; the
   best way to monitor the temperature is to use a deep fry or candy
   thermometer. After making these a few times, you will start to get
   a feel for when the oil temperature is "right."

   Meanwhile, form falafel mixture into round balls or slider-shaped
   patties using wet hands or a falafel scoop. I usually use about 2
   tbsp of mixture per falafel. You can make them smaller or larger
   depending on your personal preference. The balls will stick
   together loosely at first, but will bind nicely once they begin to
   fry.

5. If the balls won't hold together, place the mixture back in the
   processor again and continue processing to make it more
   paste-like. Keep in mind that the balls will be delicate at first;
   if you can get them into the hot oil, they should bind together and
   stick. If they still won't hold together, you can try adding {{%
   scalee 2 %}}-{{% scalee 3 %}} tbsp of flour or chickpea flour to
   the mixture. If they still won't hold, add {{% scalee 1 %}}-{{%
   scalee 2 %}} eggs to the mix. This should fix any issues you are
   having.

   Before frying my first batch of falafel, I like to fry a test one
   in the center of the pan. If the oil is at the right temperature,
   it will take 2-3 minutes per side to brown (5-6 minutes total). If
   it browns faster than that, your oil is too hot and your falafels
   will not be fully cooked in the center. Cool the oil down slightly
   and try again.

6. When the oil is at the right temperature, fry the falafels in
   batches of 5-6 at a time until golden brown on both sides. Once the
   falafels are fried, remove them from the oil using a slotted
   spoon. Let them drain on paper towels.

7. Serve the falafels fresh and hot; they go best with a plate of
   hummus and topped with creamy tahini sauce. You can also stuff them
   into a pita.

8. **Sesame Falafel Variation:** After forming the balls or patties,
   dip them in sesame seeds prior to frying. This will make the
   falafel coating crunchier and give it a slightly nutty flavor.

9. **Herb Falafel Variation (Green Falafel):** Add {{% scalee 0.5 %}}
   cup additional chopped green parsley, or cilantro, or a mixture of
   the two prior to blending.
