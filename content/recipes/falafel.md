Makes {{% scalee 30 %}} - {{% scalee 34 %}} falafel balls

## Ingredients:
* {{% scalee 1 %}} lb **DRY** chickpeas - you must start with dry, do
  NOT substitute canned, they will not work!
* {{% scalee 0.5 %}} tsp baking soda
* {{% scalee 1 %}} small onion, roughly chopped
* {{% scalee 1 %}} large bunch of fresh parsley
* {{% scalee 1 %}} large bunch of fresh dill
* {{% scalee 1 %}} large bunch of fresh mint
* {{% scalee 3 %}}-{{% scalee 5 %}} cloves garlic
* {{% scalee 1.5 %}} tbsp flour or chickpea flour
* {{% scalee 1.75 %}} tsp salt
* {{% scalee 2 %}} tsp cumin
* {{% scalee 1 %}} tsp ground coriander
* {{% scalee 0.25 %}} tsp black pepper
* {{% scalee 0.25 %}} tsp cayenne pepper
* {{% scalee 1 %}} Pinch of ground cardamom
* Enough vegetable oil for frying - grapeseed, sunflower, avocado,
  canola, and peanut oils all work well

## Recipe:
1. **One day ahead**, cover dry chickpeas in 2 inches of water. Add
   {{% scalee 0.5 %}} tsp baking soda to water and stir (softens the
   chickpeas). Cover the bowl and let soak overnight in the
   fridge. Soak for 12 - 24 hours, ideally changing the water after 12
   hours.

2. Drain the chickpeas.

3. Add chickpeas and all other ingredients (other than oil) to the
   food processor. Pulse until you have a coarse meal that looks like
   couscous, mix after every few pulses. Split into multiple batches
   if needed.

4. Cover the chickpea mixture and refrigerate for 1 - 2 hours.

5. Fill a dutch oven with about 1 - 2 inches of oil. Heat oil to about
   {{% temperaturee 360 %}} - {{% temperaturee 375 %}} or until the
   chickpea mixture bubbles immediately when you drop a bit into the
   oil.

6. Form the balls, slightly smaller than golf ball sized.

7. Drop balls into the oil and let bubble/cook until you can see they
   are a bit brown then flip them over to cook on the other side
   (about 2 - 3 mins per side).

8. Let cool on paper towels so any excess oil gets soaked up.
