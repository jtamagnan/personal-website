For {{% scalee 1 %}} 9 inch pie tin

## Ingredients:
* {{% scalee 3 %}} tablespoons of ice water
* {{% scalee 0.5 %}} teaspoon salt
* {{% scalee 1.25 %}} flour
* {{% scalee 0.5 %}} cold butter
* {{% scalee 100 %}}g / {{% scalee 7 %}} tbsp unsalted butter, cold,
  cut into 1cm/ 1/3" cubes

## Recipe:
1. Place flour, salt and butter in a food processor.
2. Pulse 10 times or until it looks like breadcrumbs.
3. With the motor running on low, pour 2.5 tbsp of water into the tube
   feeder.
4. Turn up to high and blitz for 30 seconds or until it turns into a
   ball of dough. Initially it will look like breadcrumbs, then it
   will turn into a ball of soft dough - some random escaped bits is
   fine. If it doesn't look like its coming together at 20 seconds,
   add another {{% scalee 0.5 %}} tbsp of water. Don't blitz longer
   than 30 seconds at most.
5. Form a disc, wrap in cling wrap. If there are escaped crumble bits,
   that's fine - just press them in. Refrigerate for 1 - 3 hours.
6. Preheat oven to {{% temperaturee 390 %}} (standard) or {{%
   temperaturee 350 %}} (fan forced)
7. Sprinkle work surface with flour, unwrap dough and place on the
   flour. Sprinkle top with flour, then roll out into a 27cm/11"
   round.
8. Gently roll the pastry so it wraps around the rolling pin.

### Assembly:
1. Unroll it over the quiche pan or pie dish - 23cm / 9".
2. Press the pastry into the edges of the quiche pan, patching up
   edges if required (if pastry doesn't quite reach top of rim).
3. Roll the rolling pin across the top to cut off the excess pastry.

### Blind Bake:

Blind baking your crust will help ensure that the crust doesn't turn
out soggy. I never do this but one can.

1. Refrigerate for 15 minutes
2. Place a large piece of parchment paper over the pastry, then fill
   with baking beads or lots of rice or dried beans to weigh it
   down.
3. Bake for 20 minutes, then remove from oven.
4. Turn oven DOWN to {{% temperaturee 350 %}} (or {{% temperaturee 320 %}} fan).
5. Use excess paper to CAREFULLY remove hot beads, then return to oven
   for 10 minutes or until base is light golden.
