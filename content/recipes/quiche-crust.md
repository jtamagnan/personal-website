## Ingredients:
* {{% scalee 3 %}} tablespoons ice water
* {{% scalee 1.25 %}} cups all-purpose flour
* {{% scalee 0.5 %}} teaspoon sea salt
* {{% scalee 8 %}} tablespoons unsalted cold butter, sliced into small cubes

## Recipe:
1. Place flour, salt and butter in a food processor.
2. Pulse 10 times or until it looks like breadcrumbs.
3. Continue to pulse the food processor while slowly adding 2.5 tbsp of water into the tube feeder.
4. Continue to pulse until it turns into a ball of dough. Initially it will look like breadcrumbs, then it will turn into a ball of soft dough - some random escaped bits is fine. If it doesn't look like its coming together at 20 seconds, add another {{% scalee 0.5 %}} tbsp of water. Don't blitz longer than 30 seconds at most.
5. Form a disc, wrap in cling wrap. If there are escaped crumble bits, that's fine - just press them in.
6. Refrigerate for 1 - 3 hours.
7. Preheat oven to {{% temperaturee 390 %}} (standard) or {{% temperaturee 350 %}} (fan forced)
8. Sprinkle work surface with flour, unwrap dough and place on the flour. Sprinkle top with flour, then roll out into a 27cm/11" round.
9. Gently roll the pastry so it wraps around the rolling pin.
